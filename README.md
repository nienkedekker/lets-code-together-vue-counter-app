## Setup
Either set up the project locally by cloning it, or by using CodeSandbox.

### CodeSandbox
If you're using CodeSandbox, you won't have to worry about installing anything locally.
1. Just go to CodeSandbox.io and click on "Create Sandbox".
2. Then choose "Import Project" and copy this repository's URL.
3. Click "Generate Sandbox" and give it a few seconds to allow it to boot.

### Setting it up locally
1. Clone this repo: `git clone xx`
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn run serve` for local development
4. Run `yarn run build` to compile for production

## Workshop goals

Participants should be able to answer the following questions:

- Why use a front-end framework like React/Vue?
- What are the most important differences between React and Vue?
- What are React/Vue components?
- What is state management?

Participants can:

- Set up a React or Vue app
- Integrate CSS into the project
- Make and apply a reusable component
- Manage state (on component level)
